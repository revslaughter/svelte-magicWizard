# The Svelte Magic Wizard

Still an extreme work in progress.

The idea:
  - Form content is data-driven. Form pages and questions can be configured with JSON alone
  - Can also include criteria and validation for pages and questions in your application
  - Answers can be stored according to question ID and handled using programmable logic
  - Svelte, because fast!
